Twinkle Tray lets you easily manage the brightness levels of multiple monitors. Even though Windows 10 is capable of adjusting the backlight on most monitors, it typically doesn't support external monitors. Windows 10 also lacks any ability to manage the brightness of multiple monitors. This app inserts a new icon into your system tray, where you can click to have instant access to the brightness levels of all compatible monitors.

**Features:**
- Adds brightness sliders to the system tray, similar to the built-in Windows 10 volume panel.
- Normalize backlight across different monitors.
- Can automatically change monitor brightness depending on the time of day.
- Seamlessly blends in with Windows 10. Uses your Personalization settings to match your taskbar.
- Starts up with Windows.

This app was built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [node-ddcci](https://github.com/hensm/node-ddcci), [wmi-client](https://github.com/R-Vision/wmi-client), and [win32-displayconfig](<https://github.com/djsweet/win32-displayconfig>).

## Compatibility
Twinkle Tray uses DDC/CI and WMI to communicate with your monitors. Most monitors offer DDC/CI compatibility, but it may be off by default. Make sure you have the appropriate option(s) enabled on your monitor so that it can work with Twinkle Tray. Refer to your monitor's user manual for more information.

**Known issues:**
- The AMD Radeon Control Panel can interfere with Twinkle Tray. Ensure "Custom Colors" is not enabled.
- VGA may not be compatible.
- USB/Thunderbolt/Surface docks with HDMI or DisplayPort may not be compatible. 

If some of your monitors are not being detected, please see [this page](https://github.com/xanderfrangos/twinkle-tray/wiki/Display-Detection-&-Support-Issues) for troubleshooting steps.

## Command Line Arguments

Twinkle Tray (v1.13.0+) supports requesting brightness changes from the command line. Twinkle Tray must already be running. One monitor argument and one brightness argument are required. Multiple arguments will override each other.

For example: `"%LocalAppData%\Programs\twinkle-tray\Twinkle Tray.exe" --MonitorNum=1 --Offset=-30` will adjust monitor number 1 by -30 brightness.

### Supported args:

- `--MonitorNum` Select monitor by number. Starts at 1. *Example: `--MonitorNum=2`*
- `--MonitorID` Select monitor by internal ID. Partial or whole matches accepted. *Example: `--MonitorID="UID2353"`*
- `--All` Flag to select all monitors.
- `--Set` Set brightness percentage. *Example: `--Set=95`*
- `--Offset` Adjust brightness percentage. *Example: `--Offset=-20`*
- `--Overlay` Flag to show new brightness levels in the overlay *Example: `--Overlay`*

*This feature is not available on the Windows Store version of Twinkle Tray.*
